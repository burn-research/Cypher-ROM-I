# Hands-on session on reduced-order models I

In this session, we are going to have a look at how we can use the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a combustion dataset.

As we'll see, POD and PCA represent the same mathematical technique, but they are employed in slightly different ways. POD is generally used for the analysis of time-evolving reacting flows while PCA is used to find a low-dimensional representation of the thermo-chemical space (the manifold).

After the hands-on session, the notebook with the solution will be added to this repo.
